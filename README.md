#SlugEngineVk - Vulkan Rendering Work

*Hire me in two years please, I am improving everyday! (Will work for peanuts, I need a foot in the door)*

Slowly building a game engine using Vulkan. It's a grind but is SUUUUUPEERRRRR fun!

## Road Map:
Rendering Engine -> Physics Engine -> Gameplay

### DevLog (When can I call myself a developer?)
Hopefully I will get there! I am practicing hours and hours everyday. The
improvements I have seen, particularly over the last couple of weeks, have been
super motivating. My code is getting wayyyy cleaner;
I can shoot out exactly what I have in mind much more quickly,
    and with very few bugs or overlooked errors; I can recognise where bugs are sitting more consistently. 

It is nice to open the 'common' dir and see all the modules I have now, all of which are in use, (except 
for Vec<> sort of).

My Vim is also improving a lot, but my typing still has so much to be desired: although it is improving, 
it still seems so slow, and with so many errors...
